Use Bugsnag for Smarter Error Handling
--------------------------------------

I'm no longer maintaining the airbrake notifier since I've moved to using
[Bugsnag](https://bugsnag.com). I recommend you start using Bugsnag to
track errors in your Android apps too.

Bugsnag is better suited to tracking exceptions on mobile applications
and has a bunch more awesome features such as user-centric error counts,
smart grouping, chat notification (HipChat, Campfire, etc) automatic ticket
creation (GitHub Issues, Pivotal Tracker, Lighthouse, Codebase, etc) and
more.

You can still find the [deprecated airbrake notifer on github](https://github.com/loopj/airbrake-android).
